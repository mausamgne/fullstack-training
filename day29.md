## `useCallback` Hook in React

### What is `useCallback`?

The `useCallback` hook in React is used to memoize a function, meaning that it will "remember" the function and only re-create it if its dependencies change. This optimization is helpful in React because it prevents functions from being recreated on each render, which can improve the performance of your components, especially when passing functions as props to child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Why Use `useCallback`?

In React, each render creates new function instances, even if the function code hasn't changed. If these functions are passed as props to child components, it can cause the children to re-render, leading to performance issues in more complex applications. `useCallback` helps to avoid this by ensuring that a function keeps the same reference between renders unless its dependencies change.

### Syntax

```javascript
const memoizedFunction = useCallback(() => {
  // function code here
}, [dependency1, dependency2, ...]);
```

- **Callback Function**: The function to be memoized.
- **Dependency Array**: The list of dependencies that the function depends on. If any of these dependencies change, the function is recreated; otherwise, the same instance is reused.

### How `useCallback` Works

The `useCallback` hook effectively "caches" the function. When the component re-renders, React checks if the dependencies of the function have changed. If they haven't, React will use the cached version of the function from the previous render, reducing the need to re-create it and preventing unnecessary re-renders in children that rely on that function.

### When to Use `useCallback`

- **Passing Functions to Child Components**: When you pass functions as props to child components, particularly if the child component uses `React.memo()` or other memoization techniques, `useCallback` can prevent the child from re-rendering.
- **Event Handlers and Callback Dependencies**: For stable references of event handlers or callbacks that depend on specific props or states, memoizing with `useCallback` can make the code more predictable and efficient.
  
### Example Scenario

In a scenario where a button in a parent component triggers a callback passed down to a child component, `useCallback` can be used to ensure that the callback function does not change unless its dependencies do, avoiding unnecessary re-renders of the child component.
